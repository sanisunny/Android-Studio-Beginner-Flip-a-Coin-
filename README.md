# Android-Studio-Beginner-Flip-a-Coin-

This is a simple application that flips a coin and presents the outcome (Heads or Tails) at the press of a button. 
I worked with OnClickListeners, Images, the Random math function, and equating values. 
I hope to expand on this by adding animation to the coin itself.
The repository doesn't reflect commits because I uploaded all code onto github at once, once the app was all finished.
